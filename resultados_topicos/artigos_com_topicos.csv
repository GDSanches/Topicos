6,INCORPORATING RISK-SENSITIVENESS INTO FEATURE SELECTION FOR LEARNING TO RANK,2016,"Learning to Rank (L2R) is currently an essential task in basically all types of information systems given the huge and ever increasing amount data made available. While many solutions have been proposed improve L2R functions, relatively little attention has paid improving quality feature space. strategies usually rely on dense representations, which contain noisy or redundant features, cost learning process, without any benefits. Although selection (FS) can be applied reduce dimensionality noise, side effects such procedures neglected, as risk getting very poor predictions a few (but important) queries. In this paper we propose multi-objective FS that optimize both aspects at same time: ranking performance risk-sensitive evaluation. For this, approximate Pareto-optimal set for optimization new original application L2R.

29,THE STATUS QUO OF SYSTEMS-OF-INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2019,"The modernization of business processes have pressured Software-Intensive Information Systems (IS) to interoperate with several types of systems, such as cyberphysical systems, drones, satellites, and mobiles, arising a new type of complex systems so-called Systems-of-Information Systems (SoIS). Despite the novelty of the area as it has been known, it follows a trend of previous complex systems, such as Federated Information Systems and Large-Scale Information Systems. However, operational and managerial independence of IS constituents have created a new type of system that must be understood to suitably support new business and modernize old ones, such as pizza delivery via drone swarms. Hence, to sustain the area and achieve advances, it is necessary to externalize the state of the art and practice of the area. However, the lack of literature mappings on this topic can hamper the evolution of the area and pose difficulties to its progress, besides making it difficult to obtain relevant information about existing gaps and advances that could be made in the future. This paper presents results of a Systematic Mapping (SM) carried out to investigate the status quo of SoIS domain. We bring a panorama of this research topic and also indicate research perspectives. From a set of 212 studies, 25 were selected, analyzed and had their data extracted.

Commercial database and manufactures' websites were used to identify major brands of child-oriented foods. Samples were categorized as ""children's foods"" (n = 214) and ""infant's foods"" (n = 86). Nutrition Facts labels were used to calculate the median Na content (mg/serving, mg/kcal, and mg/100g); the ingredient lists to note the use of food additives. The sodium content found in samples varied widely among brands. The amount of sodium was high (> 210 mg/serving) in 20% of the products. Sodium density exceeded 1 mg/kcal in 40% of the products with the savory foods had the highest densities. More than 30% of the foods categories (corn snacks, filled biscuits, sliced loaf bread, and cereals) did not fulfill the 2014 sodium reduction targets. Food additives present in all children's foods varied from two to nine additives numbers. However, some products had incredible numbers of additives, such as instant noodles and mini cakes. Although some infants' foods categories were additives free, most products contained up to three numbers of additives.

248,USO DE BIOENSAIO COM ALLIUM CEPA L. PARA AVALIACÃO DE CITOTOXICIDADE DE CROTON URUCURANA BAILL,2020,"Croton urucurana Baill is a medicinal plant popularly known as Sangra d’água because when its trunk is cut, it produces resin and is a dark red color like a blood. The bark and the resin of this plant are used as a natural remedy due to anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiseptic, and healing properties. However, there are few studies that prove its effectiveness and safety. The use of biological assays to assess the bioactivity of a plant extract and compound has often been applied for the identification and monitoring of potentially toxic substances. This study aims to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the resin extract of medicinal plant C. urucurana through bioassay with Allium cepa (onion). The peeled onions were placed in a container with distilled water for 24 hours to stimulate the root growth. After that period, the healthy onion bulbs were selected for the experiment and were treated with six different resin concentrations (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 750 ppm). The test was carried out for 96 hours. The onions treated with distilled water were used as its control. At the end of the trial, the root size of the bulbs was measured, were selected ten samples for each treatment. The results showed that the extracts in the doses and exposure times evaluated, were cytotoxic and delayed the roots growth of the onions. The roots length decreased with increasing the extract concentrations. The means of treatments group are significantly different from the mean of the control (p<0.05), analyzed using Dunnett’s test. The inhibition rates were more than 50% at 250, 500, and 750 ppm with values 63, 81, and 86% respectively. In summary, the resin caused an inhibition in the Allium root growth which the intensity depends on the concentrations applied. 61 Keyword: Allium cepa L. Cytotoxicity. Croton urucurana Baill.",0,0.0

364,EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF A CEMETERY ON GROUNDWATER BY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS,2023,"Water analyses in conjunction with hydrological and geotechnical investigations were carried out to assess the potential for groundwater contamination from the decomposition of buried human bodies. Water samples were collected from 2007 to 2018 in three monitoring wells built within the cemetery area. Water quality was evaluated based on the determination of 25 analytical parameters (20 physical–chemical and 5 microbiological). Laboratory data reported by the local sewage water company for water collected in household cisterns located outside the cemetery area were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis showed a similar pattern between iron content, turbidity, and rainfall data collected at the rainfall station closest to the study area. This behavior is a direct consequence of soil leaching (oxisol). The physical characterization of the soil of the unsaturated area above the aquifer indicates that the absorption of body waste by the soil is favored, preventing surface contaminants from reaching the aquifer. This work also found that the water samples collected outside the cemetery area do not comply with the Brazilian limits for drinking water. In conclusion, water samples collected from monitoring wells located within the cemetery area have little to none impact on both subsurface and underground contamination.",-1,0.0

This study sought to examine the opportunities and challenges of this integration, as well as to present a practical example of how AI can enrich teaching dynamics. The methodology employed included detailed bibliographic research, using a deductive approach to critically analyze various sources and reach reasoned conclusions on the subject. However, the insertion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education promises a significant change in the dynamics of teaching and learning. By enabling the personalization of teaching and offering predictive analytics of student progress, AI aims to improve the educational experience, making it more adaptive and effective. However, this transition faces challenges, such as concern about teacher replacement and the need for an ethical and responsible approach to the use of technology. To ensure positive impacts, it is essential to invest in teacher training and establish guidelines to protect students' rights. The practical application of AI in Early Childhood Education, exemplified by Graphogame for syllable formation, demonstrates the benefits of technology in teaching. However, it is crucial to integrate technology in a way that is complementary to the role of the teacher to ensure a more inclusive and personalized educational environment.

851,AVALIAÇÃO DA APRENDIZAGEM NA PROPOSTA DE INVESTIGAÇÃO MATEMÁTICA COM O GEOGEBRA,2020,"Apresentamos uma experiência sobre o processo de avaliação em educação Matemática, vivenciada num curso de licenciatura em Matemática. Representa uma proposta de intervenção relacionada a inserção de tecnologias na educação Matemática, numa metodologia denominada de Investigação Matemática com o GeoGebra, que pode ser resumida em seis etapas: experimentar, conjecturar, formalizar, generalizar, monitorar e avaliar. A ideia principal consiste em desenvolver processos investigativos sobre problemas matemáticos e, no desenrolar da atividade, avaliar o desenvolvimento do aluno. Inicialmente é proposto um problema investigativo como arranque da aula. A partir disso, realizamos com o aluno experimentações utilizando o software GeoGebra que, com a mediação pedagógica do professor, possibilitará suscitar conjecturas a serem formalizadas. Em seguida, para validar ou formalizar as conjecturas, o escolar, juntamente com o professor, deverá procurar argumentos adequados de acordo com o desenvolvimento cognitivo dos estudantes. A generalização consiste em investigar se o problema pode ser generalizado, uma característica do pensamento matemático. O processo avaliativo perpassa todo processo desde o princípio, iniciando com um monitoramento de toda atividade, com a finalidade de garantir que todos os escolares participem do processo e possibilite uma aprendizagem mais eficaz. No final, os alunos devem apresentar como atividade avaliativa um projeto de intervenção com a finalidade de percebermos seu nível cognitivo com relação a aprendizagem de conteúdos matemáticos e com relação a proposta metodológica. Como resultados exitosos, temos percebido a adesão de alunos e professores da Instituição, constatados na produção monográfica e artigos publicados por eles.",0,0.0

Unfortunately, recycling strategies rarely consider the resulting ash as a potential fertilizer. To evaluate this recycling strategy for a sustainable circular economy, we characterized bagasse ash as a fertilizer and measured the effects of co-gasification and co-combustion of bagasse with either chicken manure or sewage sludge: on the phosphorus (P) mass fraction, P-extractability, and mineral P phases. Furthermore, we investigated the ashes as fertilizer for soybeans under greenhouse conditions. All methods in combination are reliable indicators helping to assess and predict P availability from ashes to soybeans. The fertilizer efficiency of pure bagasse ash increased with the ash amount supplied to the substrate. Nevertheless, it was not as effective as fertilization with triple-superphosphate and K<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>SO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, which we attributed to lower P availability. Co-gasification and co-combustion increased the P mass fraction in all bagasse-based ashes, but its extractability and availability to soybeans increased only when co-processed with chicken manure, because it enabled the formation of readily available Ca-alkali phosphates. Therefore, we recommend co-combusting biomass with alkali-rich residues to increase the availability of P from the ash to plants.</jats:p>",11,0.0

Substantive equality appears as an essential aspect to which another way of life must be constructed. The study carried out here is a product of the conceptual analysis of some of the author's fundamental texts, in which he deals with the concept of substantive equality in a deeper way and articulated with other themes. As a summary of this study, the revolutionary socialist perspective is discussed from Meszaros proposition, as most viable alternative for non-extermination of humanity on the planet, in an effective sustainable plan in addition to the typical reformisms the capitalist world. IGUALDAD SUSTANTIVA Y ALTERNATIVA SOCIALISTA PARA LA HUMANIDAD: la perspectiva de Istvan Meszaros Esta exposicion busca discutir un concepto fundamental trabajado por el filosofo Istvan Meszaros, el concepto de igualdad sustantiva. Tal nocion parte de la problematizacion de algunos principios que formaron el cimiento ideologico, politico y economico de la modernidad, como son la libertad y la igualdad. La nocion de igualdad sustantiva es tomada por su potencial articulador de la vida social, en la construccion de un mundo en que prevalezcan los lazos propiamente socialistas, a partir de la cooperacion irrestricta de ""sujetos libremente asociados"". La igualdad sustantiva aparece como aspecto imprescindible por el cual otro modo de vida debera ser construido. El estudio aqui realizado es producto del analisis conceptual de algunos textos fundamentales del autor, en los que trata del concepto de igualdad sustantiva de modo profundizado y articulado con otros temas. Como sintesis de este estudio, la perspectiva socialista revolucionaria es discutida a partir de la proposicion de Meszaros, como alternativa mas viable para el no exterminio de la humanidad del planeta, en un plano sustentable, ademas de los reformismos tipicos del mundo capitalista.",0,0.0

Education is social praxis that aims to insert subjects in the historical process, while contributing to the construction of their subjectivity. The marginalized subjects, those who are forced to occupy the borders and not be at the center of things, need greater participation in the construction of society, in order to eliminate or minimize this situation of marginalization. As examples of these subjects we can mention transsexuals, refugees and Latin American immigrants. For the purposes of this study, we consider as a transsexual woman every person who claims recognition as a woman and a transsexual man is every person who claims recognition as a man, regardless of biological sex. The refugee, on the other hand, is the whole person, who, due to wellfounded fears of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, association with a particular social group or political opinion, finds themselves outside their country of origin. And a Latin American immigrant is anyone who comes from a country in the so-called Latin America that chose Brazil as a place of residence.

1659,REQUIREMENTS FOR M-LEARNING ACTIVITIES,2018,"Mobile learning or m-learning is the expression used to designate a new educational ""paradigm"", which is based on the use of mobile technologies. Thus, it is possible to call m-learning any form of learning through any small format devices, with autonomous and small size power supply, that is possible to accompany people anywhere and at any time (Moura, 2009, p.39). Educators are challenged today to search for teaching tools that can be used within the classroom as interactive methodologies that make the educational environment increasingly digital (Prensky, 2012). Gómez (2015, p.29) reinforces that ""it is necessary to reinvent the school so that it can develop knowledge, skills, attitudes, values and emotions."" The Unesco report (2014) presents the benefits that the use of mobile learning provides, among them we can facilitate individualized learning, provide immediate feedback and evaluation, ensure the productive use of time in the classroom, support learning outside the classroom to bridge the gap between formal and non-formal learning, to expand education in different places, to make it easier for students with disabilities, to enable learning anywhere and at any time, to build different learning communities and to improve communication among students and between students and teacher. According to Sharples et. al., (2007) mobile learning does not replace formal education at all, it simply provides support within and outside the classroom for the conversations and interactions of everyday life. For Vavoula & Sharples 2002, we learn through space as we take learning ideas and resources acquired in one place and apply or develop in another. We also learn through time, reviewing previously acquired knowledge, ideas and strategies in a completely different and broader context. When we move from topic to topic, we manage a variety of learning rather than following a unique curriculum. In this sense, it is important to investigate different requirements related to m-learning projects, to improve the development and analysis of them. Thus, this work analyzed some proposals regarding the requirements and principles found in the literature, such as: Parsons, Ryu & Crenshaw (2007), Uden (2007), Koole (2009), Peng, Su, Chou and Tsai (2011), Schmitz, Klemke, & Specht (2012), Abdullah, Hussin, Asra, & Zakaria (2013), Ng & Nicholas (2013), Taylor, Sharples, O'Malley, Vavoula, & Waycott (2004), Zurita & Nussbaum (2007), Huang, Lin, & Chuang (2007), Yau & Joy (2010), Chang, Yan & Tseng Sharples (2009), Sha, Looi, Chen and Zhang (2012), Herrington, Herrington & Mantei (2009) and Churchill, Fox & King (2016).",0,0.0

1851,EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION OF MICROWAVE FILTERS,2011,"The optimization of circuits with the aim of improving performance, lowering costs, and more recently, to reduce the size and weight of electronic devices, among other objectives, has become a research field in the areas of mathematics and engineering around the world (Antoniou & Lu, 2007). The problem can be interpreted as: among all possible models for the circuit, considering topology and values of components, find a model with minimum size and appropriate parameters, able to meet a set of typically conflicting hard specifications. The deterministic methods are not effective in the design of new circuits, since it does not always have available accurate mathematical models of the processes to be optimized (Levy et al., 2001). However, a number of new stochastic algorithms have allowed the development of nearly optimal circuits, which are quite acceptable from the standpoint of their implementations. The techniques currently used require much prior knowledge about the circuit to be optimized and this knowledge is not always available. The challenge, then, is the development of robust techniques that rely less in specialist knowledge or even incorporating this knowledge, and show efficiency equal or superior to the traditional methods. In general, due to the complexity of the problems associated with different types of circuit designs, sub-optimal solutions are looked for in order to mitigate the mathematical complexity of the analytical models, generating approximate solutions, but with acceptable results (Levy et al., 2001). Evolutionary methods, so called because they use principles of evolution found in nature, are natural candidates to this task, since they are able to find optimal solutions or solutions near the optimum, using mechanisms of selection, crossover and mutation (Holland, 1970). Most methods in the literature consider an initial topology for the circuit and only optimize its parameters, such as, for example, in (Hsu & Huang, 2005). However, it is desirable that the topological structure also goes under optimization, allowing, among other things, the search for new topologies, which is a requirement of current applications. Other methods, using the traditional Genetic Programming as in the work of Koza (Koza et al., 1996), optimize the topology, without considering any prior knowledge, but demand a high computational cost and also have some methodological drawbacks such as premature convergence and stagnation, among others (Hu & Rosemberg, 2004).",2,0.0

1898,O VÍRUS DO CAPITAL E AS MOLÉSTIAS DA MERCADORIA,2020,"O trabalho em questão fundamenta-se na tese de que a crise sanitário-humanitária imposta pela pandemia (Sars-cov-2, o novo coronavirus/COVID-19) emergiu como um gatilho detonador de uma nova fase da crise estrutural do capital, caracterizada pela confluência de diversas crises próprias das leis econômicas. Nesse sentido, acelerou processos de transformações que já se encontravam em curso, de tal forma a explicitar a disputa pelos mercados futuros, principalmente, no âmbito da economia digital, todavia, presente em uma multiplicidade de mercados tradicionais, tais como o energético, visto que os mercados são estruturados em relações de interdependência. Assim, a crise abriu um novo ciclo de acumulação do capital que tendencialmente caminhará para o redesenho das relações internacionais, bem como da relação entre capital-imperialismo e periferia.

2024,EVOLUTIONARY RISK-SENSITIVE FEATURE SELECTION FOR LEARNING TO RANK,2019,"Learning to Rank (L2R) is one of the main research lines in Information Retrieval. Risk-sensitive L2R is a sub-area of L2R that tries to learn models that are good on average while at the same time reduce the risk of performing poorly in a few but important queries (e.g., medical or legal queries). One way of reducing risk in learned models is by selecting and removing noisy, redundant or features that promote some queries in detriment of others. This is exacerbated by learning methods that usually maximize an average metric (e.g., mean average precision (MAP) or Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)). However, historically feature selection (FS) methods have focused only on effectiveness and feature reduction as the main objectives. Accordingly, in this work we propose to evaluate FS for L2R with an additional objective in mind, namely risk-sensitiveness. We present novel single and multi-objective criteria to optimize feature reduction, effectiveness and risk-sensitiveness, all at the same time. We also introduce a new methodology to explore the search space, suggesting effective and efficient extensions of a well-known Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) for FS applied to L2R. Our experiments show that explicitly including risk as an objective criterion is crucial to achieve more effective and risk-sensitive performance. We also provide a thorough analysis of our methodology and experimental results.",-1,0.0

2167,LOSS ANALYSIS DUE TO INFLUENCE OF HARMONICS IN A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM,2021,"The electrical system is subject to rules to guarantee a standard, where several factors can reduce its quality. This can lead to undesirable consequences, such as increased electrical losses in the distribution. As the technology advances and the constant presence of non-linear loads, the electrical network is subject to harmonic distortions that increase the effective value of the current, resulting in inconvenient effects, such as increased losses. In another words, a bigger fraction of the energy is lost by Joule effect and a smaller fraction came to the final consumers. In Brazil, the regulatory agency, in its recommendations, does not consider the effect of harmonic components, obtaining lower results for losses. So, to analyze the influence of these distortions on the operation of a distribution network, simulations were done with the test system LVTestCaseNorthAmerican, with 390 buses. Three distinct climatic cases were analysed, each with a load shape generated from fuzzy logic, all considering the presence of non-linear loads. The simulations were made in OpenDSS, and the losses demonstrated for the three situations. Finally, the importance of considering these distortions in the calculation of losses is discussed.",-1,0.0

2236,CARTER?S FACTOR CALCULATION USING DOMAIN TRANSFORMATIONS AND THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD,2012,"<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The main purpose of this work is to present a methodology to calculate Carter's factor using the actual air‐gap geometry, that is, without simplifications of the slot geometry. The methodology is based on the finite element method, and its results are compared with some traditional procedures used for Carter's factor calculation and also with a domain transformation technique. It is shown that the finite element method and the domain transformation methodologies present similar results, which are different from the results obtained with traditional procedures.

2274,MEMORIAL DE LEANDRO NOGUEIRA DIAS: UMA HISTÓRIA DA SUPERAÇÃO DO SILÊNCIO AO GRITO DA LUTA E RESISTÊNCIA POR VÁRIAS OUTRAS VOZES (APRESENTAÇÃO),2021,"<jats:p>O presente e poético memorial foi escrito no segundo semestre de 2018 pelo, então, jovem professor do Instituto Federal do Maranhão, Leandro Nogueira Dias, para a ocasião de definição de orientador(a) no âmbito do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Educação Profissional (ProfEPT) do Instituto Federal de Goiás, Câmpus Anapólis. Escrito com as vívidas e concretas tintas de sua vida pessoal, acadêmica e profissional, o texto carrega a densidade da escolha de um objeto de estudo brotado do sofrimento e, posterior e concomitamente, da alegria da escolha de se reconhecer e de se dar a conhecer como sujeito homessexual feminino perante a família e a sociedade.Seu objeto, a invisibilidade dos sujeitos LGBTI+ pelas práticas pedagógicas na educação profissional e tecnológica, tem, portanto, como ponto de partida sua materialidade histórica com suas condicionalidades. No decurso das cinco partes do Memorial, o leitor tem catárticos encontros com o Leandro enquanto um sujeito social, ativo e condicionante da construção social que,  determinado a intervir na estrutura, vai se desvencilhando do casulo para as metamorfoses enquanto ser humano, recriando-se e se autocondicionando-se apesar dos “conquanto que”.Na primeira parte, intitulada “Quando tudo começou, era para ser apenas brincadeira de toda criança”, Leandro, a partir de uma perspectiva sociointeracionista da infância, rememora suas vivências nos primeiros anos da década de 90, tanto no sítio no interior de Tocantins quanto sobre seu ingresso na escola.  Ao tratar sobre esses contextos, ele recupera suas memórias sobre o “brincar”:  enquanto naquele não havia distinção entre brincadeiras, coisas (e etc) de meninos e de meninas; neste vivenciou o diametralmente o oposto. Balizando gênero enquanto sexo (de nascimento), a escola da educação infantil, cuja finalidade precípua é oportunizar condições do desenvolvimento de aprendizagem por meio da brincadeira, do cuidado, do afeto, da socialização e da autonomia da criança para criar e produzir saberes a partir de suas vivências e experiências no espaço escolar e fora dele, passou a ser para o Leandro um lugar de repressões, de imposições de comportamentos ditos para homens ou para mulheres, de  início de encasulamento...Na segunda parte (Anos Fundamentais: o menino com os sofrimentos de menina), intensifica-se o mutismo das práticas pedagógicas em relação às ações de bullying e violência sexual sofridas pelo Leandro no espaço escolar. Sem pensar e agir sobre uma educação sexual ancorada no determinismo biológico e religioso, a escola seguia reproduzindo modelos sociais conservadores e excludentes, bem como relações hegemônicas heteronormativas, heterossexista e patriarcais. Por sua vez, o Leandro seguiu encausulando-se em sua dor, angústia, ocultamento de sua sexualidade...Com um rigor teórico que uma análise marxista exige, Leandro escreve a terceira parte de seu memorial, a saber Vida é mesmo uma bobagem ou uma irrelevância. Adensa, primeiramente, sobre sua subjetividade, trazendo a tona uma discussão sobre a fragilidade humana em face da violência, cuja face é a de ausência de amor do outro pelo outro. Em seguida, resgata suas memórias do ensino médio. Foi aqui nessa etapa da Educação Básica, mais especificamente por força do universo da leitura, da literatura e do teatro, que ele sofre sua primeira mudança, tornando-se uma crisálida que brilha no palco, mas que fora dele se rehumaniza e compreende, radicalmente, o sentido do respeito, da tolerância, das diferenças e da alteridade.Por fim, na quarta e quinta partes, nomeadas “Na educação superior: a Borboleta sai do casulo” e  “ProfEPT: Do silêncio ao grito, luta e resistência”, Leandro tece sobre seu período de metamorfose, que é marcado por sua brilhante trajetória acadêmica e profissional, que vai de estudante de Pedagogia a estudante de pós-graduações lato e stricto sensu, e ainda de assistente na Defensoria Pública do estado de Tocantins, a assistente administrativo do Instituto Federal de Tocantins, e por fim, a docente no Instituto Federal do Maranhão em apenas seis anos.E, foi no contexto escolar, mais particularmente o da EPT, que Leandro não se limitou a compreender o mundo como os filósofos idealistas. Em alternativa, pôde  atuar de forma pronta e radical na transformação das práticas pedagógicas conservadoras que vivenciou na educação básica. Orquestrou, destarte, dois projetos interventivos “xô assédio: bate- papo sobre elas, com eles e elas!”) e “Põe a cara no sol, querida, com o objeto de constituir e consolidar um coletivo horizontal constituído por docentes e discentes, que visava a promover ações de empoderamento e de emancipação das minorias LGBTI+ contra todas as formas de preconceito, discriminação, bullying e homofobia dentro daquela escola e dos distintos espaços sociais.Não obstante ao seu (re)encontro, um acidente de moto ocorrido no dia 31 de julho de 2020, ceifou de forma trágica a vida de Leandro. É, por isso, que este texto foi escrito por mim, como uma forma de homenagear um ser humano belo e pleno que apesar dos desencontro pela vida, pôde alçar vôo e inspirar tantos de nós a farfalhas as nossas asas. E, é sob este colorido mais arco-íris que convido a você a ler este vívido (para sempre) memorial. </jats:p>",-1,0.0

Here, two sequential generations of female rats were supplemented with soybean oil (SO, rich in n‐6 FA, control group), fish oil (FO, rich in n‐3 FA) and hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF, rich in trans FA) from pregnancy and during lactation. In adulthood, half of each group was exposed to an amphetamine (AMPH)‐induced mania animal model for behavioral, biochemical and molecular assessments. FO supplementation was associated with lower reactive species (RS) generation and protein carbonyl (PC) levels and increased dopamine transporter (DAT) levels, while HVF increased RS and PC levels, thus decreasing catalase (CAT) activity and DAT levels in hippocampus after AMPH treatment. AMPH impaired short‐ (1 h) and long‐ (24 h) term memory in the HVF group. AMPH exposure was able to reduce hippocampal BDNF‐ mRNA expression, which was increased in FO. While HVF was related to higher <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> FA (TFA) incorporation in hippocampus, FO was associated with increased percentage of n‐3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) together with lower n‐6/n‐3 PUFA ratio. Interestingly, our data showed a positive correlation between brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and short‐ and long‐term memory (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.53; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.000/<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.32; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.011, respectively), as well as a negative correlation between PC and DAT levels (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.23; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.015). Our findings confirm that provision of n‐3 or TFA during development over two generations is able to change the neuronal membrane lipid composition, protecting or impairing the hippocampus, respectively, thus affecting neurothrophic factor expression such as BDNF mRNA. In this context, chronic consumption of <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> fats over two generations can facilitate the development of mania‐like behavior, so leading to memory impairment and emotionality, which are related to neuropsychiatric conditions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",13,0.0

In this system, capacitor switching is applied during operation, while theoretical and practical results are presented for the application of this switching in a three-phase asymmetric induction motor of 20 hp. Key words: Startup current, capacitor switching, three-phase induction motor, asymmetric motor, power factor. 1. Introduction The aim of the present study is to benefit rural locations, where the electric energy distribution system, which is almost entirely single-phase, is presented as strong ally of the rural resident by improving life quality. These qualities are seen in the use of energy for domestic use or as an aggregate added to the production process, thus contributing to obtaining production and quality indexes in their products. Currently, the development of new techniques concerning irrigated planting and even the benefit of agricultural products in the very places of production, according to Ref. [1], impose on the rural producer the need to increase the consumption of electric energy, mainly in terms of maximum demand. However, with availability of electric energy based on the single-phase system, the rural producer is bound to have the peculiarities imposed by such a system. The proposal of this study is to demonstrate that the asymmetric induction motor is apt for operations with Corresponding author: Prado Wellington, M.E., professor, research fields: electrical and control machines. variable loads, using capacitor switching according to the load applied on the machine, as the asymmetric motor only presents adequate operation if it operates with a nominal load. The result of this study will show that the asymmetric motor can be used in the rural scenario, where there exist variable loads. Within this context, this paper will present a study that is eminently technical-scientific, as an important point that still has not been covered is the performance of the three-phase induction motor with a single-phase supply from a variable load, which is from a no load condition until 100% of load. This study seeks to create an analysis for a number of different load conditions through the implementation of capacitor switching with the aim of minimizing the torque oscillations during operation. 2. Mathematical Modeling of the Three-Phase Asymmetric Induction Motor In order to obtain better precision in the theoretical calculation of the electromagnetic torque, the modeling in the time domain includes the spatial harmonics of the magnetic field that arise from the machine windings.

It is observed that in almost all cases, the slope of the logarithm of the density of states S(E) is not infinite in the ground state, since as expected it should be directly related to the inverse temperature 1T$\frac {1}{T}$. Here, we show that these finite slopes are in fact due to finite-size effects and we propose an analytic expression aln(bL) for the behavior of ΔSΔE$\frac {\varDelta S}{\varDelta E}$ when L→∞. To test this idea, we use three distinct two-dimensional square lattice models presenting second-order phase transitions. We calculated by exact means the parameters a and b for the two-states Ising model and for the q = 3 and 4 states Potts model and compared with the results obtained by entropic sampling simulations.

2434,ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE OF BUILDINGS UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURES USING SUCCESSIVE APPROXIMATION TECHNIQUE,2020,": This paper presents an investigation of the disproportionate collapse of multi-store steel buildings in a natural fire situation due to the progressive failure of their columns. For this purpose, it is intended to evaluate the effects of the redistribution of stress and vertical displacements of columns with the evolution of the temperature addressing, also, the impacts of the localized faults of these structural elements. In addition, another objective of this paper is the development of a practical analysis approach, which is called by successive approximations. As a methodology, advanced computational techniques were developed to predict the structural behavior of the building as the temperature reduces the strength and stiffness of its structural elements. For the parametric study, the overall response of the building was investigated through fire simulations in many columns. The results showed that the phenomenon of redistribution of stresses that occur during the heating period is essentially due to the reduction in the modulus of elasticity of the steel. In addition, the study pointed out that the use of advanced computational techniques through the use of successive approximations technique is an excellent alternative to study the progressive collapse of buildings subject to high temperatures.",-1,0.0
2436,APPLICABILITY OF PAVEAIR FOR AIRPORT PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT: COMPARISON BETWEEN MILITARY AND CIVILIAN RUNWAYS,2020,": Nowadays, globalization has become essential, and interconnection between people and cargo has become necessary due to international trade and investment. In this context, aviation is an important modal because of its efficiency in security, range, and speed; however, the aerodrome infrastructure capacity is not always sized according to the demand and safety regulations required during operations. The number of runway occurrences in Brazil increased considerably since 2011. These occurrences are consequences of several contributing factors, of which runway conditions and airport infrastructure can be considered the most important; however, the quality of runways and the flight safety they provide can’t be quantified through direct statistics. Adhering to a high standard of airfield quality while also knowing airport infrastructure, a study that applies an evaluation of the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) methodology has been developed. First, the airfield pavement at a military base was analyzed and later compared to the results found in a civil airfield study done by another author. The methods used to identify distress in the pavement’s surface were based on ASTM D 5340-12, as are PCI calculations. Secondly, the system was infused into PAVEAIR-FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) to apply an airport management method at a military base to compare the results obtained by other authors for a civil airfield study, where it was intended to analyze the performance characteristics of the runway for each type use. Subsequently, one can obtain subsidies of decisions for the optimization of resources used in airfield maintenance and rehabilitation, and increase operational safety.",0,0.0

2680,THE INFLUENCE OF DEEP UNCERTAINTIES IN THE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE OF RESIDENTIAL RAINWATER HARVESTING SYSTEMS,2023,"Abstract The Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RWHS) have been used as water conservation alternative to guarantee access to water in urban areas facing increasing demand and climate variability. However, the functioning of these systems depends on socio and economic parameters that usually are defined as constant in traditional viability analyses. The variability of these parameters is not well represented by predefined probability functions, being named in the literature as deep uncertainty factors differentiating from well-characterized uncertainties whose probability functions are known. This research aimed to evaluate the influence of uncertainties (deep and well characterized) in the performance of RWHS in three towns in the State of Goiás, Brazil (Rio Verde, Ipameri and Formosa). Technical (Satisfied Demand - SD, Reliability - REL and Rainwater Consumed - RH) and economic (Net Present Value - NPV, Net Present Value Volume - NPVV and Benefit Cost Rate - BCR) performance criteria were evaluated under a set of 1,000 states of the world comprised of climate (rainfall) and deep uncertainty factors (water tariff, discount rate and operational costs). According to selected performance criteria, the RWHS performed well in 50.01%, 46.19% and 38.01% of the scenarios in Rio Verde, Ipameri and Formosa, respectively. It was possible to illustrate the impact of the water tariff and the discount rate in the performance of RWHS in all three cities showing the need to incorporate the variability of these parameters when evaluating RWHS as alternative source of water supply in urban areas. Highlights • Deep Uncertainties had significant influence in the performance of Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RWHS) • RWHS configurations (differentiated by system demands and roof areas) perform differently when considering isolated or combined economic and technical criteria • RHWS are more likely to contribute to urban water security when evaluated as an alternative source of water supply • Households with higher levels of demand and larger roof areas are more likely to benefit from RWHS as an alternative source of water supply in future changing scenarios",0,0.0

The desirable microfluidic structure was photo‐patterned in a poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) film deposited on glass substrate to produce a low‐relief master. Then, this template was used to generate a high‐relief pattern in stiffened PDMS by increasing of curing agent /monomer ratio (1:5) followed by thermal aging in a laboratory oven (200°C for 24 h). The stiffened PDMS masters were used to replicate microfluidic devices in PMMA based on soft embossing at 220–230°C and thermal sealing at 140°C. Both embossing and sealing stages were performed by using binder clips. The proposed protocol has ensured the replication of microfluidic devices in PMMA with great fidelity (>94%). Examples of MCE devices, droplet generator devices and spot test array were successfully demonstrated. For testing MCE devices, a mixture containing inorganic cations was selected as model and the achieved analytical performance did not reveal significant difference from commercial PMMA devices. Water droplets were successfully generated in an oil phase at rate of ca. 60 droplets/min (fixing the continuous phase flow rate at 100 μL/h) with size of ca. 322 ± 6 μm. Glucose colorimetric assay was performed on spot test devices and good detectability level (5 μmol/L) was achieved. The obtained results for two artificial serum samples revealed good agreement with the certified concentrations.

Bi in Aluminum based alloys works as a self‐lubricating agent, improving machining and wear properties. As Bi is a soft material, it is essential to evaluate how it affects microstructural features and the resulting properties of Al–8 wt%Si alloys. Herein, this hypoeutectic alloy is modified by the addition of 2.5 wt%Bi and subjected to three solidification techniques: differential scanning calorimetry, transient directional solidification, and impulse atomization. Thus, this work investigates the effect of Bi in samples solidified under a wide range of cooling rates. Of specific interest is how Bi modifies the eutectic silicon morphology and alloy hardness compared with a hypoeutectic Al–10 wt%Si alloy from the literature. The silicon (Si) morphology of Al–8 wt%Si–2.5 wt%Bi transitions from flaky (coarse) to fibrous (fine) at a critical cooling rate of 1100 K s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Through the combination of Bi addition and processing through impulse atomization, the ternary Al–Si–Bi alloy achieves improvements in hardness of up to 20% compared to Al–10 wt%Si. This is despite having a coarser eutectic microstructure than the binary hypoeutectic Al–Si alloy. This is due to Bi modifying the morphology of the eutectic Si.</jats:p></jats:sec>",10,0.0

3235,CHARACTERIZATION OF A HIGH EFFICIENT N-DOPED TIO2 PHOTOCATALYST PREPARED VIA FACTORIAL DESIGN,2016,"The preparation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles doped with nitrogen for application as a photocatalyst in the decomposition of azo dyes was optimized by factorial planning. Five variables were evaluated and the results showed that the stirring method of the reaction medium, the nitrogen source and the calcination temperature are the determining parameters that affect the photocatalytic activity. With this methodology, it was possible to obtain an optimized photocatalyst (K1) with high surface area and high mineralization efficiency (100%) of the dye Ponceau 4R under solar irradiation. K1, its non-doped version and the worst photocatalyst obtained by the factorial planning (K2) were characterized by several techniques to rationalize the different behaviors. The observed mineralization rate constants under artificial UV-A radiation were in the order of 10−2, 10−4 and 10−3 min−1, respectively, for K1, K2 and the non-doped oxide. As shown by N2 sorption isotherms, the powders exhibited large variations in porosity as well as in the specific surface area, with values ranging from 63.03 m2 g−1 for K1 to 12.82 m2 g−1 for K2. Infrared spectra showed that the calcination of the doped oxides between 300 and 500 °C leads to considerable loss of the nitrogen content, which is corroborated by XPS measurements that also indicate the presence of oxygen vacancies on their surfaces. Nanosecond transient absorption measurements show that the electron–hole half-lifetime in K1 is 870 ns, ca. two times longer than that observed for the other photocatalysts. Additionally, dye degradation studies under solar radiation reveal that K1 is ca. 28% faster than the non-doped TiO2 under similar conditions. This higher photoactivity for K1 is attributed to its extended visible light absorption and the optimized morphological and electronic properties.",1,0.0

In this study, our objective was to analyze and fill gaps in data from rainfall stations located in the southwest of the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, based on three statistical methods: Regional Weighting (PR), Simple Regression (RS) and Multiple Regression (RM). For this purpose, monthly rainfall data from 23 automatic hydrometeorological stations were used, supported by the HidroWeb online platform and Hidro 1.4 software from the National Water Agency (ANA), from 1991 to 2020, also using the hypsometric map of the Southwest Planning Region of Mato Grosso (RPSMT). The dataset was represented by 8,280 rainfall records (i.e., 30 years x 23 stations). The Double Mass (DM) technique was used to assess data consistency, after completing 308 identified gaps. The results indicated that all 23 stations showed homogeneity in the data, with R² &gt; 0.97 (strong). The smallest mean deviations were observed in the dry period, using the Regional Weighting and Simple Regression methods, while the largest deviations were observed using the Multiple Regression method. It is concluded that the PR method presented the best performance to estimate the missing data, as the RS method did not obtain satisfactory results for the southwest region.Keywords: Data gaps; rainfall stations; regional weighting; simple and multiple regressions.</jats:p>",0,0.0

Methods Cross-sectional study that analyzed data from the 2019 National Health Survey. The population of interest was adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 years. Data were collected through individual interviews during home visits. Dependent variables included major risk factors for chronic noncommunicable diseases. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were used as independent variables. Multiple Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between independent variables and risk factors. Results A total of 10,460 individuals (5,001 men and 5,459 women) were included. Regardless of sex, the most prevalent risk factors were insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption (92.6%) and leisure-time physical inactivity (43.3%). The prevalence rates of tobacco smokers, alcohol consumption once a month or more, and alcohol abuse were 8.9%, 28.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. Regular consumption of soft drinks and/or artificial juices was described by 17.2%. The prevalence of overweight was 32.5%. Young adults, males, and individuals with lower educational levels, of black race/skin color, with lower household income, and residents of urban areas had a higher prevalence for most risk factors. Differences in the determinants were found for some factors. Inequalities between Brazilian regions were recorded for seven of the nine factors analyzed. The most socioeconomically developed regions had the highest prevalence of most risk factors.

However, it is questionable whether these public policies have been effective in contributing to adequate nutrition. The aim of this article is to study the effectiveness of public food security policies in Brazil between 2012 and 2022. Also, urban agriculture is analyzed as an alternative food policy that can be carried out by the population, and contributes to the use of urban space. To understand the country’s food security situation and the effectiveness of public policies in avoiding a scenario of hunger and insecurity, the hypothetical-deductive method and the technique of bibliographical and documentary research are used, together with the theoretical framework in the theory of the cycle of public policies. It is concluded that the public policies developed were gradually weakened, and that between 2019 and 2022, the Brazilian government took measures discouraging the implementation of food policies.

A pesquisa para execução do instrumento consistiu de 13 etapas: 1) criação do sinal qualidade de vida; 2) desenvolvimento das escalas de respostas em Libras; 3) tradução por um grupo bilíngue; 4) versão reconciliadora; 5) primeira retrotradução; 6) produção da versão em Libras a ser disponibilizada aos grupos focais; 7) realização dos grupos focais; 8) revisão por um grupo monolíngue; 9) revisão pelo grupo bilíngue; 10) análise sintática/semântica e segunda retrotradução; 11) reavaliação da retrotradução pelo grupo bilíngue; 12) filmagem da versão para o software; 13) desenvolvimento do software WHOQOL-BREF e WHOQOL-DIS em Libras.RESULTADOS: Características peculiares da cultura da população surda apontaram a necessidade de adaptações na metodologia de aplicação de grupos focais quando compostos por pessoas surdas. As convenções ortográficas da escrita das línguas sinalizadas não estão consolidadas, o que trouxe dificuldades em registrar graficamente as etapas de tradução. As estruturas linguísticas que causaram maiores problemas de tradução foram as que incluíram expressões idiomáticas do português, muitas sem conceitos equivalentes entre o português e a Libras. Foi possível construir um software do WHOQOL-BREF e WHOQOL-DIS em Libras.CONCLUSÕES: O WHOQOL-BREF e o WHOQOL-DIS em Libras possibilitarão que os surdos se expressem autonomamente quanto a sua qualidade de vida, o que permitirá investigar com maior precisão essas questões.</jats:p>",-1,0.0

Este artigo, cuja metodologia de pesquisa é de cunho bibliográfico, buscou nos textos de História de Matemática subsídios para sua fundamentação teórica. Sua conclusão é baseada em achados recentes a partir das interpretações da escrita complexa da sociedade babilônica.  Por essa via, mostramos que o historiador é mesmo como um equilibrista sem a rede protetora para sustentar uma eventual queda, pois descobertas arqueológicas recentes, permitem-nos concluir fatos novos que alteram aqueles que são aceitos como verdades, revelando uma nova história para o Cálculo Diferencial e Integral. Essas descobertas recentes alteram as interpretações sobre a gênese do Cálculo Diferencial e Integral. Indicamos o modo como astrônomos babilônicos antigos calculavam a posição de Júpiter no céu a partir da área sob o gráfico da velocidade pelo tempo, utilizando o método conhecido hoje como o método do trapézio. Este resultado, obtido de interpretação de tábulas de argila babilônicas de 400 e 50 a. C., altera a História do Cálculo Diferencial e Integral, uma vez que se acreditava que foram matemáticos europeus do século XIV que descobriram esse modo de operar. Contribuímos com o movimento lógico e histórico do Teorema Fundamental do Cálculo e entendemos que isso é um fato importante pois altera o modo como pensamos e faz jus aos babilônios que possuíam uma Matemática muito desenvolvida.</jats:p>",-1,0.0

O agronegócio brasileiro tem seu reconhecimento internacional e expande a cada ano novos contratos para o fornecimento de seus produtos agropecuários. São os avanços conquistados ao longo de décadas na genética, melhoramento de plantas e animais, fertilidade e manejo de solo e plantas. Áreas como o Cerrado brasileiro transformaram em regiões de grandes produções de produtos agropecuários. A expansão de cultivos com elevado nível de tecnologia chegam a consumir 90% do total de fertilizantes utilizados no Brasil. Como a matéria-prima dos fertilizantes são importados, os custos fixos têm-se elevado nos últimos anos. No intuito de reduzir os custos de produção, tem-se buscado fontes alternativas e algumas rochas têm-se demonstrado potencial em fornecer nutrientes às culturas. O remineralizador K-LI foi obtido da mina localizada no Estado do Tocantins, o mineral pertence a Formação Pimenteira, posicionada diretamente sobre xistos, como caracterização de conglomerados e arenitos. O estudo foi conduzido na Escola de Agronomia da Universidade Federal de Goiás, situada no município de Goiânia, Goiás, em casa de vegetação em dois solos: Latossolo Vermelho distrófico de textura argilosa e um Latossolo Vermelho Amarelo de textura média.

Nesse contexto a presente pesquisa busca analisar a formação docente no Instituto Federal do Acre – Campus Cruzeiro do Sul, discutindo como essa formação vem sento trabalhada na percepção dos docentes do referido campus. Foi realizada pesquisa bibliográfica, documental, e aplicação de questionários junto aos docentes. Os dados foram analisados e discutidos a luz dos referencias teóricos que discutem a formação continuada na educação de modo geral e na EPT. Como resultado a pesquisa aponta que a formação docente verticalizada (pós-graduação) cresceu significativamente no Campus, mas que a formação continuada horizontal nas temáticas didático-pedagógicas pouco tem sido realizada no Campus. Mostrou também que as jornadas pedagógicas do campus pouco têm contribuído para a melhoria das práticas docente e que os mesmos desejam ter formações continuadas de cunho pedagógico que os façam refletir e discutir as problemáticas enfrentadas em sala de aula.</jats:p>",-1,0.0

The law reserves 20% of teaching vacancies filled through federal civil servant examinations for Black people. We observe the distance that separates the legally-stipulated conditions and actual practice in these institutions. As five years have now gone by since the passage of this legislation, it seems safe to say that the goal of expanding racial/color diversity in federal civil service will not be achieved through public examinations for teaching careers. Moreover, meeting this goal becomes progressively harder, given the present scenario of resurgence of meritocratic discourses that question the legitimacy of affirmative actions for Afro-Brazilians.

Constatamos que o percentual legalmente previsto esta longe do praticado nas universidades federais e institutos federais. Passados mais de cinco anos desde a aprovacao da lei, parece que o objetivo de ampliar a diversidade de raca/cor no servico publico federal nao sera alcancado por concursos para as carreiras docentes, em um cenario de recrudescimento de discursos meritocraticos que colocam em xeque a legitimidade de acoes afirmativas para pessoas negras. Concursos Publicos, Carreiras Docentes, Negro, Acoes Afirmativas Federal civil service examinations for university faculty and affirmative actions for racial equality In this study, quali-quanti methodology was applied to analyze the implementation of Law no. 12,990/2014 on quotas for Black candidates at 63 federal universities and 38 federal ‘institutes’ (secondary and vocational training), during the period that spanned 2014 to 2018. The law reserves 20% of teaching vacancies filled through federal civil servant examinations for Black people. We observe the distance that separates the legally-stipulated conditions and actual practice in these institutions. As five years have now gone by since the passage of this legislation, it seems safe to say that the goal of expanding racial/color diversity in federal civil service will not be achieved through public examinations for teaching careers. Moreover, meeting this goal becomes progressively harder, given the present scenario of resurgence of meritocratic discourses that question the legitimacy of affirmative actions for Afro-Brazilians.

This strategy was implemented both in simulation (Matlab/ Simulink® ) and experimentally (through DSP). Results with and without the freewheeling step were compared, showing that its addition for the SRG magnetization control substantially increases the energy conversion capability.

A step-by-step for the mechanical and electrical magnitudes sizing is demonstrated, both for prototype construction and for graphic representation in CAD software. Thus, with the drawing of SRM lamination plate, the mutual inductance is measured trough a finite element software called FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics), whose values are processed and arranged in inductance matrices with the aid of MATLAB®. Once with inductance matrices, the mathematical modeling is implemented on SIMULINK MATLAB® and the results are presented.

4513,INEXPENSIVE AND NON¿CONVENTIONAL FABRICATION OF MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES IN PMMA BASED ON A SOFT¿EMBOSSING PROTOCOL,2020,"This study describes an inexpensive and nonconventional soft‐embossing protocol to produce microfluidic devices in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The desirable microfluidic structure was photo‐patterned in a poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) film deposited on glass substrate to produce a low‐relief master. Then, this template was used to generate a high‐relief pattern in stiffened PDMS by increasing of curing agent /monomer ratio (1:5) followed by thermal aging in a laboratory oven (200°C for 24 h). The stiffened PDMS masters were used to replicate microfluidic devices in PMMA based on soft embossing at 220–230°C and thermal sealing at 140°C. Both embossing and sealing stages were performed by using binder clips. The proposed protocol has ensured the replication of microfluidic devices in PMMA with great fidelity (>94%). Examples of MCE devices, droplet generator devices and spot test array were successfully demonstrated. For testing MCE devices, a mixture containing inorganic cations was selected as model and the achieved analytical performance did not reveal significant difference from commercial PMMA devices. Water droplets were successfully generated in an oil phase at rate of ca. 60 droplets/min (fixing the continuous phase flow rate at 100 μL/h) with size of ca. 322 ± 6 μm. Glucose colorimetric assay was performed on spot test devices and good detectability level (5 μmol/L) was achieved. The obtained results for two artificial serum samples revealed good agreement with the certified concentrations. Based on the fabrication simplicity and great analytical performance, the proposed soft‐embossing protocol may emerge as promising approach for manufacturing PMMA devices.",27,0.0

PARA AVALIACÃO DE CITOTOXICIDADE DE CROTON URUCURANA BAILL,2020,"Croton urucurana Baill is a medicinal plant popularly known as Sangra d’água because when its trunk is cut, it produces resin and is a dark red color like a blood. The bark and the resin of this plant are used as a natural remedy due to anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiseptic, and healing properties. However, there are few studies that prove its effectiveness and safety. The use of biological assays to assess the bioactivity of a plant extract and compound has often been applied for the identification and monitoring of potentially toxic substances. This study aims to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the resin extract of medicinal plant C. urucurana through bioassay with Allium cepa (onion). The peeled onions were placed in a container with distilled water for 24 hours to stimulate the root growth. After that period, the healthy onion bulbs were selected for the experiment and were treated with six different resin concentrations (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 750 ppm). The test was carried out for 96 hours. The onions treated with distilled water were used as its control. At the end of the trial, the root size of the bulbs was measured, were selected ten samples for each treatment. The results showed that the extracts in the doses and exposure times evaluated, were cytotoxic and delayed the roots growth of the onions. The roots length decreased with increasing the extract concentrations. The means of treatments group are significantly different from the mean of the control (p<0.05), analyzed using Dunnett’s test. The inhibition rates were more than 50% at 250, 500, and 750 ppm with values 63, 81, and 86% respectively.

Here, two sequential generations of female rats were supplemented with soybean oil (SO, rich in n‐6 FA, control group), fish oil (FO, rich in n‐3 FA) and hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF, rich in trans FA) from pregnancy and during lactation. In adulthood, half of each group was exposed to an amphetamine (AMPH)‐induced mania animal model for behavioral, biochemical and molecular assessments. FO supplementation was associated with lower reactive species (RS) generation and protein carbonyl (PC) levels and increased dopamine transporter (DAT) levels, while HVF increased RS and PC levels, thus decreasing catalase (CAT) activity and DAT levels in hippocampus after AMPH treatment. AMPH impaired short‐ (1 h) and long‐ (24 h) term memory in the HVF group. AMPH exposure was able to reduce hippocampal BDNF‐ mRNA expression, which was increased in FO. While HVF was related to higher <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> FA (TFA) incorporation in hippocampus, FO was associated with increased percentage of n‐3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) together with lower n‐6/n‐3 PUFA ratio. Interestingly, our data showed a positive correlation between brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and short‐ and long‐term memory (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.53; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.000/<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.32; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.011, respectively), as well as a negative correlation between PC and DAT levels (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.23; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.015).

Water samples were collected from 2007 to 2018 in three monitoring wells built within the cemetery area. Water quality was evaluated based on the determination of 25 analytical parameters (20 physical–chemical and 5 microbiological). Laboratory data reported by the local sewage water company for water collected in household cisterns located outside the cemetery area were also evaluated. Multivariate analysis showed a similar pattern between iron content, turbidity, and rainfall data collected at the rainfall station closest to the study area. This behavior is a direct consequence of soil leaching (oxisol). The physical characterization of the soil of the unsaturated area above the aquifer indicates that the absorption of body waste by the soil is favored, preventing surface contaminants from reaching the aquifer. This work also found that the water samples collected outside the cemetery area do not comply with the Brazilian limits for drinking water. In conclusion, water samples collected from monitoring wells located within the cemetery area have little to none impact on both subsurface and underground contamination.",-1,0.0

Para tal, trataremos, primeiramente, dos fundamentos ﬁlosóﬁcos, epistemológicos e pedagógicos da concepção de educação omnilateral e politécnica baseada na concepção de educação marxista, e, em seguida, das abordagens de ensino de línguas estrangeiras hegemônicas no Brasil, quais sejam, a formalista e a comunicativa e da abordagem contrahegemônica, a do letramento crítico, assumida nos documentos oficiais. A discussão teórica evidencia que a proposta de letramento crítico para o Ensino de Línguas Estrangeiras, integrada ou não às outras abordagens de ensino de línguas estrangeiras, está coerente com o princípio da formação humana integral em sua totalidade, em termos epistemológicos e pedagógicos. Levando em consideração que a maior parte dos professores de línguas estrangeiras em serviço em escolas de ensino médio (integrado à educação profissional técnica) não recebe(ra)m formação para materializar as dimensões de um ensino de uma língua estrangeira a partir de uma abordagem de letramento crítico, grandes esforços e investimentos terão quer ser demandados pelo Estado (caso lhe convenha que essa abordagem passe de prescrita à adotada), pelas escolas e, principalmente,  pelos professores para que se possa possibilitar de fato uma formação emancipatória que  não dispense, mas que não se restrinja à preparação para o ingresso no ensino superior nem tampouco ao mundo do trabalho.</jats:p>",0,0.0

4990,MEMORIAL DE LEANDRO NOGUEIRA DIAS: UMA HISTÓRIA DA SUPERAÇÃO DO SILÊNCIO AO GRITO DA LUTA E RESISTÊNCIA POR VÁRIAS OUTRAS VOZES (APRESENTAÇÃO),2021,"<jats:p>O presente e poético memorial foi escrito no segundo semestre de 2018 pelo, então, jovem professor do Instituto Federal do Maranhão, Leandro Nogueira Dias, para a ocasião de definição de orientador(a) no âmbito do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Educação Profissional (ProfEPT) do Instituto Federal de Goiás, Câmpus Anapólis. Escrito com as vívidas e concretas tintas de sua vida pessoal, acadêmica e profissional, o texto carrega a densidade da escolha de um objeto de estudo brotado do sofrimento e, posterior e concomitamente, da alegria da escolha de se reconhecer e de se dar a conhecer como sujeito homessexual feminino perante a família e a sociedade.Seu objeto, a invisibilidade dos sujeitos LGBTI+ pelas práticas pedagógicas na educação profissional e tecnológica, tem, portanto, como ponto de partida sua materialidade histórica com suas condicionalidades. No decurso das cinco partes do Memorial, o leitor tem catárticos encontros com o Leandro enquanto um sujeito social, ativo e condicionante da construção social que,  determinado a intervir na estrutura, vai se desvencilhando do casulo para as metamorfoses enquanto ser humano, recriando-se e se autocondicionando-se apesar dos “conquanto que”.Na primeira parte, intitulada “Quando tudo começou, era para ser apenas brincadeira de toda criança”, Leandro, a partir de uma perspectiva sociointeracionista da infância, rememora suas vivências nos primeiros anos da década de 90, tanto no sítio no interior de Tocantins quanto sobre seu ingresso na escola.  Ao tratar sobre esses contextos, ele recupera suas memórias sobre o “brincar”:  enquanto naquele não havia distinção entre brincadeiras, coisas (e etc) de meninos e de meninas; neste vivenciou o diametralmente o oposto. Balizando gênero enquanto sexo (de nascimento), a escola da educação infantil, cuja finalidade precípua é oportunizar condições do desenvolvimento de aprendizagem por meio da brincadeira, do cuidado, do afeto, da socialização e da autonomia da criança para criar e produzir saberes a partir de suas vivências e experiências no espaço escolar e fora dele, passou a ser para o Leandro um lugar de repressões, de imposições de comportamentos ditos para homens ou para mulheres, de  início de encasulamento...Na segunda parte (Anos Fundamentais: o menino com os sofrimentos de menina), intensifica-se o mutismo das práticas pedagógicas em relação às ações de bullying e violência sexual sofridas pelo Leandro no espaço escolar. Sem pensar e agir sobre uma educação sexual ancorada no determinismo biológico e religioso, a escola seguia reproduzindo modelos sociais conservadores e excludentes, bem como relações hegemônicas heteronormativas, heterossexista e patriarcais. Por sua vez, o Leandro seguiu encausulando-se em sua dor, angústia, ocultamento de sua sexualidade...Com um rigor teórico que uma análise marxista exige, Leandro escreve a terceira parte de seu memorial, a saber Vida é mesmo uma bobagem ou uma irrelevância. Adensa, primeiramente, sobre sua subjetividade, trazendo a tona uma discussão sobre a fragilidade humana em face da violência, cuja face é a de ausência de amor do outro pelo outro. Em seguida, resgata suas memórias do ensino médio. Foi aqui nessa etapa da Educação Básica, mais especificamente por força do universo da leitura, da literatura e do teatro, que ele sofre sua primeira mudança, tornando-se uma crisálida que brilha no palco, mas que fora dele se rehumaniza e compreende, radicalmente, o sentido do respeito, da tolerância, das diferenças e da alteridade.Por fim, na quarta e quinta partes, nomeadas “Na educação superior: a Borboleta sai do casulo” e  “ProfEPT: Do silêncio ao grito, luta e resistência”, Leandro tece sobre seu período de metamorfose, que é marcado por sua brilhante trajetória acadêmica e profissional, que vai de estudante de Pedagogia a estudante de pós-graduações lato e stricto sensu, e ainda de assistente na Defensoria Pública do estado de Tocantins, a assistente administrativo do Instituto Federal de Tocantins, e por fim, a docente no Instituto Federal do Maranhão em apenas seis anos.E, foi no contexto escolar, mais particularmente o da EPT, que Leandro não se limitou a compreender o mundo como os filósofos idealistas. Em alternativa, pôde  atuar de forma pronta e radical na transformação das práticas pedagógicas conservadoras que vivenciou na educação básica. Orquestrou, destarte, dois projetos interventivos “xô assédio: bate- papo sobre elas, com eles e elas!”) e “Põe a cara no sol, querida, com o objeto de constituir e consolidar um coletivo horizontal constituído por docentes e discentes, que visava a promover ações de empoderamento e de emancipação das minorias LGBTI+ contra todas as formas de preconceito, discriminação, bullying e homofobia dentro daquela escola e dos distintos espaços sociais.Não obstante ao seu (re)encontro, um acidente de moto ocorrido no dia 31 de julho de 2020, ceifou de forma trágica a vida de Leandro. É, por isso, que este texto foi escrito por mim, como uma forma de homenagear um ser humano belo e pleno que apesar dos desencontro pela vida, pôde alçar vôo e inspirar tantos de nós a farfalhas as nossas asas. E, é sob este colorido mais arco-íris que convido a você a ler este vívido (para sempre) memorial. </jats:p>",-1,0.0
